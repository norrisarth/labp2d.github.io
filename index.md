# LabP2D

<p>Created in July 2013, the Parallel and Distributed Processing Laboratory (LabP2D) offers human and material resources to carry out research, teaching and extension activities. The services offered and research carried out at LabP2D have as their main themes the management of Computational Clouds, Computational Fog, Internet of Things and Parallel Programming. Currently, LabP2D has a private computing cloud, based. on Openstack, which hosts several projects from other departments of the institution. Furthermore, institutional partnerships between Brazilian and French research groups use the cloud to carry out experiments.

## Extensions Projects

<p>
  2022 - Current
Efficient Computing Clouds Program with Free Software and Hardware - COLMÉIA

  <ul>  
  2022/2023

Description: Computing clouds are increasingly demonstrating their importance in facilitating and democratizing access to high-performance computing resources worldwide. In this sense, since 2012 Colméia has been seeking to disseminate it at the same time as it seeks to maintain and improve a computational cloud within CCT/UDESC, the Nuvem Tchê. Extension action has evolved and now becomes a program. In this sense, the actions foreseen in the program consist of: Open Computing Clouds, Events and Efficient Cloud Computing. The Open Computing Clouds action aims to improve the culture of open solutions by encouraging the internal/external community to understand the responsibilities, implications and benefits of using cloud computing solutions with an emphasis on solutions based on OpenStack open source software, as well how to interact with the solution’s developer community. The Events action aims to promote both the holding of events (training, lectures and courses) and also participation in renowned events. Finally, the Efficient Cloud Computing action aims to use free hardware and other open technologies (e.g., IoT, IIoT) to improve sustainable and energy efficient practices.
Status: In progress; Nature: Extension.
Students involved: Bachelor's degree: (8) / Academic master's degree: (4) .

<ul>Despite the high representation of energy costs over the cost of the data center, there are few published studies evaluating electrical consumption due to the use of the processor. This represents up to 90% of the energy consumption of a server's components, and IT equipment (e.g., servers, routers) can reach 52% of the energy consumption of a data center. The rental of equipment in a data center linked to the computing cloud services model is done using the pay-as-you-go or pay-as-you-use principle. Choosing the pay-as-you-go model simplifies the billing method, charging for allocated virtual resources (processor, memory, disk and network), not for used resources. Therefore, the efficient use of resources by the cloud customer does not imply a reduction in costs. The pay-as-you-use model is based on the effective consumption of resources, motivating the cloud customer to make their application more efficient to obtain consequent cost reductions. Efficient use of resources is one of the principles of green computing and reducing electricity costs is interesting for both cloud customers and data center administrators. Preliminary experimental investigations indicate a strong relationship between processor consumption and server electrical consumption. In this context, this research project aims to present a cost model for green cloud computing that considers processor consumption and its impact on energy consumption for fair billing of virtual machines in a data center.
